\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:Conclusion}
While not telling us much about the empirical US-economy we have shown that by using a very simple regime-switching model when predicting future returns, the \citet{Campbell1999}-model is able to generate data with properties similar to the behavior of real-world stock returns. That is the predictability of stock returns are almost non-existent when examining expansionary periods, and much more predictable when examining recession-periods even when the underlying data-generating process is exactly the same.
