Compared to the calibration of \citet{Campbell1999}, our calibration suggests a higher persistence parameter, higher volatility of dividend growth and lower consumption growth, the implied surplus consumption parameters suggests a slightly higher overall surplus consumption. The differences likely stems from the extra 20 years of calibration data. \\
\subsection{Simulation}
From the calibrated model we simulate a chain of 100.000 monthly draws from the economy yielding 8.332 years of simulated time-series. Allowing us to infer about the predictability of excess stock returns, during times of simulated crisis. \\
\newline
Based upon NCER-recession data, we find that the US economy was in recession approximately 13.4\% of the period spanning January 1950 until December 2018.  In the model a recession implies that present consumption in low relative to previous periods consumption, that is the value of $s_t$ is lower than the steady state value of surplus consumption $\Bar{s}$ - integrating over the density of $s_t$ yields that the simulated economy is in recession during 37\% of all observations, which indicates that $\Bar{s}$ might be misspecified. To correct $\Bar{s}$ we match the empirical business cycle behavior by numerical optimization of the $s_t$ density, such that the empirical and simulated economy is in recession roughly the same amount. The $\Bar{s}$-value matching the empirical business cycle, throughout denoted $\Bar{s}_{rec}$ \textit{or} ($\Bar{S}_{rec}$), is found to be $-3.18$ ($0.0415$).

\end{figure}
From the constructed surplus consumption threshold $\Bar{s}_{rec}$ for recession, we construct an indicator dummy for recessions. Such that $I_{rec} = 1$ \textit{iff}. $\Bar{s}_{rec} > s_t$ and $I_{rec}=0$ otherwise.

Having simulated an economy based upon habit formation, and justified our choice of recession periods of the simulated series, we are able to test the proposed hypothesis:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Is the model of \citet{Campbell1999} able to generate returns with the following two properties
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Returns are predictable by the price/consumption- or the price/dividend-ratio under recessionary periods?
        \item Returns are unpredictable by the price/consumption- or the price/dividend-ratio under expansionary periods?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Results}
First we run 2 regressions on the following form:
\begin{align*}
     r_{t+1} - r^{f} &= \alpha + \beta_{REC} \left( p_t - c_t \right) * I_{t,REC} + \beta_{EXP} \left( p_t - c_t \right) * \left(1 - I_{t,REC}\right)  + \varepsilon_{t+1}\\
      r_{t+1} - r^{f} &= \alpha + \beta_{REC} \left( p_t - d_t \right) * I_{t,REC} + \beta_{EXP} \left( p_t - d_t \right) * \left(1 - I_{t,REC}\right)  + \varepsilon_{t+1}
\end{align*}
That is we use the recession indicator to infer the influence of the predictors in respectively recessions and expansions.\\
As a benchmark we run two additional regressions given:
\begin{align*}
     r_{t+1} - r^{f} &= \alpha + \beta \left( p_t - c_t \right)  + \varepsilon_{t+1}\\
      r_{t+1} - r^{f} &= \alpha + \beta \left( p_t - d_t \right) + \varepsilon_{t+1}
\end{align*}
Figure \ref{tab:regress} reports results of the four regressions. The desired property of separability of business cycles does not get a lot of support from this exact result. We see no increase in $R^2$, we find strong statistical evidence supporting rejection of the null-hypothesis for all estimates in all four regressions, this is however to be expected as the sample size of 8331 observations is quite large, it is well established that as the sample size increases the asymptotic variance of the OLS-estimate decreases and thus significance is inevitable as the sample size becomes quite large.

\input{Tables/RegressionTable.tex}

Instead we run a regime-switching linear regression with observable states, remember that from the simulation we obtained the surplus consumption ratio as an observable. In real data one would have to rely on latent state regressions such as \textit{hidden Markov model}, to determine the latent state as a function of $s_t$.\\
However we have the simulated series and are able to run the regression straightforward. We run four regressions again with excess stock return as the regressand:
\begin{align*}
    \left(r_{t+1} - r^{f}\right)_{REC} &=  \alpha + \beta \left( p_t - c_t \right) + \varepsilon_{t+1}\\
    \left(r_{t+1} - r^{f}\right)_{REC} &=  \alpha + \beta \left( p_t - d_t \right) + \varepsilon_{t+1}\\
    \left(r_{t+1} - r^{f}\right)_{EXP} &=  \alpha + \beta \left( p_t - c_t \right) + \varepsilon_{t+1}\\
    \left(r_{t+1} - r^{f}\right)_{EXP} &=  \alpha + \beta \left( p_t - d_t \right) + \varepsilon_{t+1}
\end{align*}

The results of the four regressions are reported in table \ref{tab:RSregress}, the results are much more interesting. Examining the results reveals that with a regime switching approach as opposed to the previous single state regression, we are able to split the effects of business cycles on the predictability of stock returns. Notice how the coefficients indicating the effects of respectively P/C and P/D ratios on excess returns have switched signs in recession periods, while the constant effect is negative during recessions, indicating the base effect of being in a recession on excess returns is negative. However while not intuitively inappropriate in this context it have to be noted that expected returns are restricted to be positive in this model, therefore mandating the the size of the log P/C and log P/D-ratios must be large enough to offset the negative constant. \\

Another result worth noting is one that provides evidence in favor of both of our hypothesis, that is the estimated coefficient of determination is much higher in the recession periods reaching 7\% when predicting excess returns using the price-consumption-ratio, than it is in expansionary periods reaching just barely .2\%, using the price-dividend-ratio as the predictor yields a smaller $R^2$ this is to be expected, as the price-dividend is by construction a noisier mapping of the price-consumption-ratio dynamics, containing not only the shock to consumption growth $\sigma$ but also the shock dividend growth $\sigma_w$.
