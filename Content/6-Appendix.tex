\section{An Appendix}
\label{sec:app1}

Here's an appendix with an equation. Note that equation numbering is quite different in appendices and that the JF wants the word ``Appendix'' to appear before the letter in the appendix title. This is all handled in \texttt{jf.sty}.
\begin{equation}
  E = mc^2.
\label{eq:eqA}
\end{equation}

\section{Another Appendix}
\label{sec:app2}

Here's another appendix with an equation.
\begin{equation}
  E = mc^2.
\end{equation}
Note that this is quite similar to Equation~\eqref{eq:eqA} in Appendix~\ref{sec:app1}.
