This paper investigates the Habit Formation model proposed by \cite{Campbell1999} ability to predict in expansions as well as the out-of-sample performance of the model. 
The history of Asset Pricing models have provided evidence of predictability in periods of economic downturn \colorbox{yellow}{\textbf{INDSÆT KILDER}}, however, there have been little evidence showing predictability in expansions. The ability to predict in expansions are a highly desired capability, due to the fact the economy historically is in the state of expansion more often than recession. In the \cite{Campbell1999} framework, recession is defined as period where surplus consumption is below steady-state, hence the models recession is not exactly equal to the definition of three quarters of negative GDP growth as we are used to...

We examine the \cite{Campbell1999} model of Habit formation in asset pricing. Investigating the models performance both in recessions, which multiple sources have provided evidence of predictability of returns, and in expansions where it has been the case to be more difficult to predict returns. 

We calibrate the model based on newer data than \cite{Campbell1999}, then we perform a simple regression with an indicator variable of recession and $(1-I_{rec}$ for expansions, this is done for the ability to distinguish between model performance in recessions as well as in expansions. 

A recession in the model is defined as when surplus consumption is below some given value, that is 

    \begin{align}
        I_{rec} & = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{, if } s_t < s_{rec} \\
                                  0 & \text{, if } s_t > s_{rec} 
                    \end{cases}
    \end{align}

in order to match the empirical amount of times the economy have been in recession according to \cite{USREC} in the period $1950 - 2018$ $\approx 13 \%$, the threshold $s_{rec}$ needs to take a value somewhere below $s_{bar}$, otherwise if $s_{bar}$ is used as threshold the economy of the model will be in recession approximately $37\%$ of the time, this three times more than the economy actually have been in the last 68 years, thus the need for lowering the threshold. The threshold value of the surplus consumption ratio is found by integrating over the stationary distribution of the surplus consumption ratio.




We show that the model of \citet{Campbell1999} is capable of generating returns consistent with the empirical findings of \citet{Henkel2011}. That is returns which inherits the properties that they are predicable in recession but unpredictable in expansions.\\

\citet{Henkel2011} found that the predictability of returns using popular measures such as the dividend yield diminishes in expansions while remaining of significance during recessionary periods. \\

We simulate an economy according to \cite{Campbell1999}, and re-calibrate the parameters of the model to an extended period spanning \textit{1950-2018} compared to \citep{Campbell1999}'s \textit{1950-1994}. In an attempt to incorporate relevant information of the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in our calibration.




Predictability of asset prices in expansions is a desirable capability since the economy is in a state of expansion more often than recession. In the period $1950-2018$\footnote{According to \cite{USREC}} the economy has been in recession $13.41\%$ of the time, hence being able to predict asset prices in expansions would yield a higher profit for investors.

%\begin{comment}
A corner area of the consumption based asset pricing is to incorporate habits in an agents preferences, \textit{Habit Formation}. The idea, initiated by \citet{Constantinides_1990}, assumes that marginal utility of consumption rely on consumption relative to stochastic habit process which is related to past consumption, thus utility is a function of both consumption and habits $u \left(C_t, X_t \right)$. This captures a fundamental psychological feature of human behavior, namely when income rises consumption only slowly adapts, thus being exposed to a stimulus again and again reduces the response. 

\citet{Campbell1999} considers a model with external habit, that is habit depends on aggregate consumption, and thus is unaffected by a single agents choices, this type of habit is also refereed to as \textit{>>catching up with the Joneses<<}. They specify the consumption utility function as a power function of differences $C_t - X_t$ and are able to match empirical features of the economy such as the excess return on stocks, the sharpratio and riskfree rate to mention a few. 

In this paper we follow \citet{Campbell1999} approach and are able to reproduce their results, then we re-calibrate the parameters of the model by extending the period spanning  $1950 \ -  \ 2018$, this includes the both the \textit{>>dot com bubble<<} in 2000 and the \textit{>>Great Financial Crisis<<} in 2007-2009, incorporating this period is an attempt to capture more recent and relevant information in the calibration. We define an indicator for recession to match the amount of times the economy has been in recession in the data period \textit{13.4\%}, and estimate both the ordinary asset pricing regression where we divide effects of predictability into recession- and expansion periods, besides this we also estimate a regime switching regression where the left hand side is conditioned upon the indicator. 
The results show that the model of \citet{Campbell1999} is capable of generating returns consistent with the empirical findings of \citet{Henkel2011}. That is returns which inherits the properties that they are predicable in recession but unpredictable in expansions.
