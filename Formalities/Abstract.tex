  \noindent We recalibrate the model of \citet{Campbell1999} on US-data and simulate 2000 years of returns in order to examine whether the model is able to generate data that is predictable during recessions. In addition we provide results on the overall out-of-sample predictability of returns generated from an external habit model.
