\centerline{\bf ABSTRACT}

\begin{doublespace}  % Double-space the abstract and don't indent it
  \noindent There's nothing very interesting here, but the format (achieved using the file \texttt{jf.sty}) makes it suitable for publication in the \emph{Journal of Finance} even if the content doesn't. Here's a nice, informative, double-spaced abstract.
