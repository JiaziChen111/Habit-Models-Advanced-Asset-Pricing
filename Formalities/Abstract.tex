  \noindent We recalibrate the model of \citet{Campbell1999} on up-to-date US-data and simulate 100.000 months of returns in order to examine whether the model is able to generate data that is predictable during recessions. In addition we provide results on the overall out-of-sample predictability of stock returns generated from an external habit model.
