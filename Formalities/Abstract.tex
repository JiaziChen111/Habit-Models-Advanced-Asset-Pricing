  \noindent We re-calibrate the model of \citet{Campbell1999} on up-to-date US-data and simulate 100.000 months of stock returns, we find that the model is able to generate returns with key-properties of empirical stock returns. Namely that the predictability of stock returns vanishes in expansions, whilst remaining sizeable in recessions. In addition we provide results on the overall out-of-sample predictability of stock returns generated from an external habit model.
